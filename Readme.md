Traffic Light Control | Assembly

This is a school project in which I designed a traffic light circuit for the ATMega16. EAGLE files are included. The program was written in assembler.

I had uploaded this project to bitbucket years ago: https://bitbucket.org/ckrex/trafficlightcontrol/src/master/

The Code was written in Atmel AVR studio.

There is also a demo on youtube where I explain the Traffic Light Control: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxdeP8pqVKY
